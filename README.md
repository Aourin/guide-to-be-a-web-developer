##The Brand New Developer

####The Disclaimer Description Reason Thing
This is a quick guide to get people who ask how to get rolling on their path to becoming a web developer. There is a lot to learn and a lot that is debateable, but this is supposed to help them get moving somewhere. Keep in my, this is from my experience. 


###Quick Start Learning
Here are a few list of things to start learning. I will be updating this repo to try and make things organized in more of a book form once I start adding content or people collaborate on it.

#####Version Control

```
What is ‘version control’, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.”

			               ---- A snippet from www.git-scm.com ----
```

I chose version control first because it is pretty important in any language you pick up. It is also is great to  start learning git from the beginning so you can pick up the habit of versioning your code.

**Git** is, if I may, the preferred choice of version control for web developers. 
Some basics you'll want to pick up at first are

- Initializing Repositories
- Fetching, Pulling, Pushing
- Branching
- Commiting (w/ messages)
- Merging/Rebasing

Once you start learning **Git**, you can also pick things up like making pull requests and working in collaborative environments.

#####The JavaScripts
JavaScript is not Java. Java is not JavaScript. Let's just get that out of the way.
